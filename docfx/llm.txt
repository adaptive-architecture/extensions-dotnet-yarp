# Extensions for dotnet YARP

> A collection of extensions for the dotnet YARP (Yet Another Reverse Proxy) reverse proxy. Provides OpenAPI specification aggregation from downstream services and authentication/authorization extensions. Targets .NET 10.0+.

The project provides two NuGet packages:

- `AdaptArch.Extensions.Yarp.OpenApi` — Automatic OpenAPI aggregation from downstream services behind a YARP reverse proxy, with path reachability analysis, schema collision avoidance, component pruning, content negotiation (JSON/YAML), and HybridCache integration.
- `AdaptArch.Extensions.Yarp.Auth` — Authentication and authorization extensions for YARP (early development).
